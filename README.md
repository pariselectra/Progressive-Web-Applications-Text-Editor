# Progressive-Web-Applications-Text-Editor

## Description

This project is a progressive web application, meaning that it can be accessed without internet access. Once the app is opened, the user can download a text editor or type directly into the text editor. Even without internet, a user's input can be accessed and saved. The application accomplishes offline saving by using local storage and a cache.
